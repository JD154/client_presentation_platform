title: 'Haulink BI Benchmark — Proposal'
description: 'Clear plan to set up a staged BI baseline.'

# Executive Summary

We will set up a simple reporting baseline that shows, in plain terms, where and why profitability changes from job execution to billing and payment. This runs only in a safe test environment and does not touch production. We will walk you through a short, prepared demo.

## Scope At A Glance

- Connect your finance system with your operations database so both sides tell the same story. We’ll show changes as they happen and also allow looking back in time.
- Outcome: Easy‑to‑read dashboards that explain where profitability shifts from the original invoice/bill and why, including a before/after view that reconciles numbers from both systems.

## BI Benchmark

- Scope
  - Bring across invoices, bills, payments, and related records from QuickBooks and connect them to what happened in Haulink operations.
  - Show updates quickly when things change, and also run scheduled refreshes to make sure nothing is missed.
- Deliverables
  - Test environment set up; automatic data updates; clean, well‑organized data from finance and operations, plus combined views; 3–5 executive dashboards; a short visual map and guide that explains where each number comes from.
- Timeline
  - 3–5 business days after we have access and you approve the plan.
- Acceptance Criteria
  - Short, guided demo with prepared data; spot‑checks that show QuickBooks and Haulink match for selected invoices/bills/payments; a simple visual map of how numbers are connected; no distracting errors during the demo.
- Demo Plan
  - 15–20 minutes agenda in the test environment: answer 3 questions live — where profits swing and why, how results vary by asset/category, and a clean before/after reconciliation view.

## Approvals, Setup, and Security

- Environments: Runs in a sandbox environment. No production changes.
- Access: Give us only the minimum access needed.
- Change process: We share a short plan and test checklist for your sign‑off before we touch anything. If you use a Change Request Document (CRD), we’ll follow your format and submit it for approval first.

## Risks and how we handle them

- Sync limits or errors: We retry, alert, and reconcile missing data.
- Differences between systems: We provide simple comparison views; QuickBooks on one side, Haulink on the other, and the linked view in the middle; so it’s clear what needs attention.
- Dashboards built incorrectly: If someone untrained changes formulas, results can be wrong. Mitigation: one accountable owner builds and reviews the dashboards; once approved, dashboards are treated as “do not edit” unless changes are requested.

## How we measure success

- No unexpected errors during demos.
- Data updates run reliably on schedule and when changes happen.
- Matching results: for checked items, Haulink’s data shows the same reality as QuickBooks.
- One place to see results: dashboards live inside Haulink, reducing time spent switching tools.
- Status updates delivered on the agreed cadence.

## Next Steps

1. Approve BI Benchmark — Confirm environment and access. We share the simple test plan for sign‑off (and CRD if you require it). We won’t start until you approve.
2. Provision & Validate — Recreate the proof‑of‑concept in your environment; turn on automatic updates; run matching checks; finalize dashboards; share acceptance notes.
3. Acceptance & Handover — Approve the short data guide and dashboards; confirm who has access and how often reports run; agree the check‑in windows.

Sincerely,

UKLOK Team
